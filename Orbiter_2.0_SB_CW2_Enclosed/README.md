## Why?

Well, why not!? 👍

## Print Setup

All parts are printed without supports. Recommended material is PCCF, why? Well, if you are printing high temp materials in a heated enclosure, parts should not soften or loosen in any way, PCCF is very stiff, lightweight and will withstand very high temperatures without losing any of its amazing properties. Will it be ok to print it in ABS/ASA, absolutely! but the parts may not last as long as PCCF. Recommended perimeter count is 4 and 5 top/bottom layers with infil from 30%+. All parts in STL already have correct orientation, just import and print.
