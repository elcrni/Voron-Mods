## Orbiter 2.0 Stealthburner mount with CW2 shroud, PCB and EBB36 Support

## Important Note:

**All Stealthburner/CW2 parts have been changed to accomodate Orbiter extruder, meaning that no stock parts can be used for the mount. Hot end mounts and X-Rail carriage did not change, stock parts can be used here. This mount is compatible with Voron TAP**

Changed stock parts:

- SB Cover
- Chain Anchor
- Cable Cover

## Changelog
**20.12.2023.**

Front cover (main body) redesigned and is now deeper to eliminate any gap due to the part cooling fan. This is the only part that needs re-printing.

**11.06.2023.**

Added support for Rapido UHF - Thanks to [bythorsthunder](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/bythorsthunder/Stealthburner_Rapido_Uhf)
Please note: Both the cover and the Rapido UHF front mount have been changed to fit Orbiter 2.0 mod!

## Why?

Well, why not!? üëç

## Print Setup

All parts are printed without supports. Recommended material is PCCF, why? Well, if you are printing high temp materials in a heated enclosure, parts should not soften or loosen in any way, PCCF is very stiff, lightweight and will withstand very high temperatures without losing any of its amazing properties. Will it be ok to print it in ABS/ASA, absolutely! but the parts may not last as long as PCCF. Recommended perimeter count is 4 and 5 top/bottom layers with infil from 30%+. All parts in STL already have correct orientation, just import and print.


## BOM

Pretty much standard hardware as for the stock Stealthburner

- 3x M3x25mm
- 1x M3x8mm
- 1x M3x12mm
- 1x M3x20 - Tensioner screw
- 1x M3 Washer - For tensioner screw
- Brass heat inserts

P.S. These elements visible in the CAD are leftovers from early testing stage, these are NOT needed as the EEB36 PCB is held by the umbilical anchor!
